This project is a program to be run on a Raspberry Pi as the brain of a hydroponic system. 

My vision is for my designs and software to be deployed in schools around the world and for them to benefit the students using them meaningfully, and allow them to collect meaningful data.
The goal is to help students learn about biology and apply computer science skills.
This system is meant to be used for small (or large with added units) scale experiments, emphasizing affordability and accessibility. 
To support this goal, the program is controlled by a website hosted on the Pi, with an SQL database containing all the sensor data.
The software which is meant to be modified is to be written in the most common languages taught in schools. Python and MySQL, with c++ used only when necessary for sensors.
