This project is a program to be run on a Raspberry Pi as the brain of a hydroponic system. 
The goal is to help students learn about biology. 
This system is meant to be used for small (or large with added units) scale experiments, emphasizing affordability and accessibility. 
To support this goal, the program is controlled by a website hosted on the Pi, with an SQL database containing all the sensor data.
