Note that none of these programs are mine, and the code is taken from the sensor's respective wikis.
In the event that the code is outdated, search for the sensor name, usually DF or QC and then capital letters, with the word "wiki" at the end.
Then, report the outdated code to me through github.

Backlog includes support for
PASCO, SparkFun, and VWR International sensors

The setup is intended to be used for use with both analog and digital sensors, with the arduino surprisingly being cheaper than buying multiple Analog-to-digital converters. If using only one analog sensor and no plans to add more, you could use the Adafruit ADS1115 ($15). Also, no reason to buy an arduino if you only use digital sensors.
