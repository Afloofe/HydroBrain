Note that none of these programs are mine, and the code is taken from the sensor's respective wikis.
In the event that the code is outdated, search for the sensor name, usually DF or QC and then capital letters, with the word "wiki" at the end.
Then, report the outdated code to me through github.

Backlog includes support for
PASCO, SparkFun, and VWR International sensors
